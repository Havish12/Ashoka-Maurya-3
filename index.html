            <h2>Who is Ashoka Maurya?</h2>
            <p id="text1">Ashoka the emperor, also known as Ashoka the Great, was one of the most successful emperors of India to ever live. Ashoka was born in 304 BCE and died in 232 B.C.E. Ashoka had several half-brothers and sisters from his fatherâ€™s other wife. His parents had been divorced. Ashoka grew up to be a bold, troublesome, and cruel person. According to legend, he killed a lion, with only a wooden stick. His older half-brothers always feared him and somehow convinced their father to make Ashoka the Mauryan Empire.  Ashoka was the grandson of the founder of the Mauryan dynasty. Ashoka is known throughout India because of something that he did made a really big impact on the Indian society. Ashoka was once really bloodthirsty and greedy, so he wanted to expand the Indian community by fightning wars. Ashoka had to fight in a war, which is known as the Kalinga war. He came back to India successfully gaining the Kalingan land. Ashoka then saw the amount of destruction and damage that people had to deal with because of the war. This made him very guilty, and he decided that he would take the path of peace and prosperity. This meaning that he will not be able to fight any wars. Since, it was the Buddhist monks that were particularly affected by the Kalinga war, Ashoka made many temples for them. Ashoka also made many rock edicts, on pillars and inside caves. He made statues to put on top of the pillars so people would recognise that this was the doing of Ashoka and not just any ordinary pillar with words. </p>
